**TIC_TAC_TOE_GAME**

📌 Project Overview

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python.
It allows two players to play interactively in the terminal. The game checks for winning conditions and declares the winner or a draw.

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as:

      Loops

      Functions

      Conditional statements

      List handling

      User input validation

      Game logic implementation

🚀 Features

    Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)

    Interactive console interface

    Automatic win detection

    Draw detection

    Input validation for occupied positions

🛠 Technologies Used

  Python 3

  No external libraries required

🎯 Game Rules

    The board has 9 positions (1–9).
      
    Player X starts first.
      
    Players take turns entering a position number.
      
    The first player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
      
    If all 9 positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
      Through this project, I practiced:
    
    Implementing game logic in Python
    
    Designing reusable functions
    
    Handling user input and edge cases
    
    Writing clean and readable code

📌 Future Improvements
Add single-player mode with AI

Add graphical interface using Tkinter

Add score tracking system

Convert into web-based game using Flask
